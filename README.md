 A dynamic & interactive data visualisation Power BI Dashboard analyzing employee attrition data. It helps understand why employees leave, which departments or roles are most affected, and highlights key trends based on salary, tenure, age, gender and education.
The objective of this dashboard is to analyze and understand the patterns and drivers behind employee attrition in our organization. The visualizations help HR teams and management to identify areas of concern, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

To create an interactive dashboard that:
* Visualizes employee attrition by key features like department, age, gender, salary slab, etc.
* Helps HR teams monitor and reduce attrition by identifying risk patterns.
* Enhances decision-making with KPIs, filters, and comparative visuals.

# Project Insight
Highest attrition in 26â€“35 age group and salary < 5k.

Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians show the highest attrition.

Males (138) have higher attrition compared to Females (77).

Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds face greater turnover. 

There is a spike in attrition for employees with 0â€“1 years of service.

Job roles with lower satisfaction scores (1 or 2) are strongly correlated with attrition.

# Final Conclusion
Focus on the controllable factors first: salary structure, onboarding, job satisfaction, and role-based issues. These will give the most immediate improvements in reducing attrition.
Gender attrition appears stable and balanced.

HR should focus efforts on other critical issues like salary slab, early tenure exits, and specific job roles.
Salary and job satisfaction are the major drivers of attrition. Special attention is needed for early tenure employees, especially those in R&D and Sales departments. Also creating growth opportunities for high-attrition roles. There should be regular satisfaction surveys and feedback loops.
